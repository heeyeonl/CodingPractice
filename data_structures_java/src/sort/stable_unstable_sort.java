    Unstable - relative ordering of duplicate items is not preserved
    Stable - when it is preserved

    It matters when it's an Object!

    ex) 5, 9, 3, 9, 8, 4
     -> 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 9
                    -  -  if the order of 9 is flipped: unstable
                                            it not flipped: stable
    ex) bubble sort is stable sort.
