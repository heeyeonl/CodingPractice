# 10.4 Sorted Search, No Size
#   You are given an array-like data structure Listy which lacks a size method.
#   It does, however, have an elementAt(i) method that returns the element at index i in O(1) time.
#   If i is beyond the bounds of the data structure, it return -1.
#   (For this reason, the data structure only supports positive integers.)
#   Given a Listy which contains sorted, positive integers,
#   find the index at which an element x occurs. If x ooccurs multiple times,
#   you may return any index. 
#   Hints: #320, #337, #348


# Q. Am I supposed to build the data structure?
# A. Yes
