# 1.3 URLify
# Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'.
# You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, 
# and that you are given the "true" length of the string.
# (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a charactere array so that you can perform this operation in place.)
# Example:
# input: "Mr John Smith     ", 13
# output: "Mr%20John$20Smith"
# Hints: #53, #118
